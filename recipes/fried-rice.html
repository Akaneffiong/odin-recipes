 <h2>How to prepare Delicious Fried rice</h2>
 <p>Rice is beloved all across Nigeria. In general, Jollof—less flaky, and not as involved—is more commonly prepared, but there are days when my craving for fried rice with liver and shrimp will not settle until I have cooked a pot, and served it up with coleslaw, roast chicken, plantains and some Chapman.</p>
 
 <h3>Ingredients</h3>
 <ul>
     <li>4 tablespoons coconut/groundnut/other vegetable oil</li>
       <li>2 cups raw & washed rice, long grain or basmati</li>
       <li>3-4 cups Nigerian-style stock (see headnote)*</li>
        <li>1 cup onions and carrots, diced (hard veggies)</li>
        <li>1 cup spring onions, bell peppers, sweetcorn, peas, chopped (soft mixed veggies)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Nigerian/West Indian/Caribbean curry powder (or to taste)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme (or to taste)</li>
        <li>1/4 black or white pepper (or to taste)</li>
        <li>1/4 turmeric powder (or to taste)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup coconut milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup liver, diced and cooked (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shrimp or prawn, seasoned and sautéed (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup green bell pepper, diced</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Steps</h3>
 <ol>
     <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the rice and sauté for 3-5 minutes, until toasted.</li>
     <li>Add 2 cups of stock to the rice, stir and cook on low heat, with the lid on for 12-15 minutes, or till stock is absorbed and rice has softened a bit. Let cool for 5-10 minutes, then fluff and set aside.</li>
     <li>In another pot, heat up the remaining 2 tablespoons oil till hot, then add the hard vegetables. Season with a pinch of salt and stir fry for 2-3 minutes before you add the soft mixed vegetables. Let cook, another 2-3 minutes.</li>
     <li>Season to taste with curry powder, dried thyme, black/white pepper, turmeric powder.</li>
     <li>Add the rice and stir gently, but well, so rice and vegetables combine. Add 1 cup of stock and the coconut milk, cover the pot and cook on low-medium heat for 10-15 minutes or till the rice is al dente.</li>
     <li>Check for doneness and seasoning, and adjust accordingly. Add more stock if required.</li>
     <li>When rice is ready, stir in chopped liver, sautéed shrimp and diced green bell peppers. Cook for 3-5 minutes. Remove from heat and serve.</li>
