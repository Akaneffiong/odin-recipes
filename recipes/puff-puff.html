  <h2>How to prepare puff puff</h2>
  <p>Most West African countries are familiar with the popular street food Puff- Puff,  which is known by different names depending on the country. Ghanaians call it Bofrot (togbei), Cameroonians and Nigerians call it Puff-Puff (Puff) or beignet in French. The basic ingredient consist of: flour, sugar, yeast, water, salt and oil for deep frying.</p>
  <p>It is an easy and quick recipe to make with different variations. This recipe is the one I have been making for years and the one that takes me back to my hometown. It brings back memories of late night snacking on the street.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>Yeast</li>
      <li>Warm water</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
      <li>Activate the yeast: Mix salt, water, sugar, and yeast. Set it aside for 5 minutes</li>
      <li>Make the dough: Add flour and mix</li>
      <li>Rest and Rise: Let the mixture rise for approximately 1-2 hours</li>
      <li>Pre-heat the oil: In a large sauce pan, pour vegetable oil into a pot until itâ€™s about 3 inches (or 5 centimeters ) high (too little will result into a flatter balls), and place in low heat</li>
      <li>Check the heat: Test to make sure the oil is hot enough by putting a drop of batter into the oil. If the oil is not hot enough, the batter will stay at the bottom instead of rising to the top.</li>
      <li>Fry the puff puff: <br>
        Hand Method: Using your hands, grab a little bit of mixture at a time and drop into the oil. <br>
        Spoon Method: When the oil is hot enough, use a spoon to dish up the batter and another spoon or spatula to drop it in the oil. Sort of in the shape of a ball.</li>
        <li>Check the doneness: Fry for a few minutes until the bottom side is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Flip the puff puff: Turn the ball over for a few minutes until the underside is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from oil: Use a large spoon or a slotted spoon to take it out of the oil. I usually place them on napkins right away to soak up some of the excess oil.</li>
        <li>Coat the puff puff: If desired, you can roll up the finished products in table sugar or powdered sugar to make it sweeter.</li>
